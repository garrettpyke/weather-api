## Project Description
React.js application implementing a simple weather API, providing current conditions, forecast, AQI and lunar phase information for a given location. <br>

User may input a U.S. Zip Code, Canandian or UK Postal Code, city name, 3-digit IATA airport code, or latitude & longitude in decimal degrees for relevant data. <br>

Project will make use of React Hooks, React Router, and responsive web design.

## API
The API to be used is provided by [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and is updated hourly. This is a free service provided that (1) API calls do not exceed 1M per month, and (2) a link-back is given in the application itself.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
* Landing component - allows user to enter location data, and explains which location data formats may be used
* Results component - renders data for specified locale on page
   * React Router reflects location in url upon render of weather data
   * Weather icons display along with weather condition data (sunny, cloudy, etc.) (Icons also provided by WeatherAPI.)

#### PostMVP
* Language support for other than English
* Optional Air Quality Index data will be displayed if user requests
* Any Alerts for the location queried will be displayed
* Sunrise/sunset info will be provided
* Lunar phase info will display including:
   * Moon phase
   * Moonrise/moonset
   * Lunar illumination
* IP Lookup API, also part of WeatherAPI offering, will be added to extrapolate user location.   
* Potential React Router 'easter egg' for a certain family member to find

## Additional Libraries
Supporting libraries, tutorials, code snippets, etc. will be listed here.
   * Coolors (coolors.co) - color palette
   * Canva (canva.com) - design tools for Welcome/Home image

## Code Snippet
A piece of this project that I feel is somewhat clever is the brevity of Aaron.js. I was able to set up the functionality for a secondary API call without (1) needing to add a new function, or (2) creating an infinite re-render problem.
